# slide-puzzle-game
A basic slide puzzle game with its own menu screen and three different difficult levels. Made with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript (Vanilla).

This time, I took on a simple project, a puzzle game, and added a bit more challenge by including a menu where the player can select from three difficulty levels. Each level is themed around a different franchise. It was definitely a challenge for me, as JavaScript is a language I haven't quite clicked with yet.
